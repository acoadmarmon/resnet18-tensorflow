# resnet18-tensorflow
An implementation of ResNet18 using TensorFlow 2.0 Keras API. Currently ResNet 18 is not currently supported in base Tensorflow (see https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications for supported models), so a custom model is necessary to use this architecture.
